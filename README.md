# Continuous-real-time-monitoring-of-ecg-signals-i.e.Holter-monitor-using-IOT-technology
â€“Designed a continuous ECG monitoring system(i.e.,Holter Monitor),A portable mobile sized device can wear and it monitors the ECG signals 24/7,ECG signals can monitor from remote area to hospital by doctor and patient relatives through mobile app and the app will send notification when the emergency situation occurs.For location tracing GPS and to check patient body function temperature,pulse rate,SPO2 sensors also connected with the device.To reduce the power consumption solar batteries are used and rechargeable batteries and port also added for emergency situation.Comparing to normal holter monitor this device takes low power and cost effective and efficiency of this device is also high.
